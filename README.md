# 🏭 Inventory Management System (C++)

## 📘 Overview
This project is a simple **Inventory Management System** written in **C++**.  
It demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **Data Structures** such as `vector` and `map` to manage products efficiently.

The system allows you to:
- ➕ Add new products  
- 🔍 Search products by ID or name  
- 📝 Update product details  
- ❌ Delete products  
- 📋 Display all available products
